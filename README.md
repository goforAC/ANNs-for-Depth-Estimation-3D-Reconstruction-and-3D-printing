# ANNs-for-Depth-Estimation-3D-Reconstruction-and-3D-printing
A course I took in my second Master semester. The project itself was fun and  required me to learn new programming languages in short time, working with different environments and bridging between these.

### minion_report.pdf leads you through the whole project

if you are interested in getting the dataset, drop me a line. The small dataset consists of 2000 unique minions.
The code can be extended to create more minions by refining sizes differences or adding new materials or structures.
